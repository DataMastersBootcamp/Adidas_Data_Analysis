# Adidas US Sales Analysis Project

1. Introduction
This project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of Adidas sales in the United States. Utilising data-driven insights, the project seeks to understand sales trends, customer preferences, and regional performance. The analysis is encapsulated in a Jupyter notebook titled Adidas_sales_Analysis.ipynb, which explores various facets of the sales data, ranging from exploratory data analysis to predictive modelling.

2. Dataset Description
The dataset, Adidas_US_Sales_Datasets.csv, comprises 9648 entries spanning several key metrics:

1. Retailer Information: Includes retailer name and a unique retailer ID.
2. Sale Details: Contains the invoice date, product type (e.g., Men's Street Footwear), units sold, and total sales value.
3. Financial Metrics: Provides data on price per unit, operating profit, and operating margin.
4. Geographical Information: Covers the region, state, and city of each sale.
5. Sales Method: Indicates whether the sale was in-store or another method.


3. Analysis Overview
The Jupyter notebook conducts a meticulous analysis in several stages:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Initial stage focusing on preparing the data for analysis by handling missing values and refining data types.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth exploration of the dataset through various visualisations, aiming to uncover trends and patterns.
Sales Trend Analysis: Examination of sales over time to identify seasonal trends and other temporal patterns.
Predictive Modelling: Implementation of forecasting models like ARIMA to predict future sales trends.

4. Results and Conclusions
The analysis yields valuable insights into Adidas' sales dynamics in the US market. Key findings include:

Seasonal trends and their impact on different product categories.
Performance analysis of various regions and states in terms of sales volume and profitability.
Predictive forecasts providing a future outlook on sales trends.

The project concludes with actionable recommendations based on the insights derived from the data, potentially guiding strategic decisions for Adidas' sales and marketing teams.

5. Usage
To delve into the analysis, open the Adidas_sales_Analysis.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment. Ensure all dependencies are installed as specified in the notebook. The dataset Adidas_US_Sales_Datasets.csv should be placed in the same directory as the notebook for seamless integration.
